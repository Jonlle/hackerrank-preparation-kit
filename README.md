# HackerRank Preparation Kit Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the **1 Month Preparation Kit** on HackerRank. The challenges are organized by difficulty: **Basic**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced**. Each folder includes the code solution and an explanation of the approach used.

## Structure
- **basic/**: Challenges focusing on fundamental programming concepts and algorithms.
- **intermediate/**: Challenges involving complex data structures and algorithms.
- **advanced/**: Challenges covering advanced topics such as dynamic programming and optimization.
- **mock-tests/**: Mock tests for each week's progress.

## Getting Started
Each challenge is in its own folder with the following structure:
- `solution.<extension>`: The code implementation of the solution.
- `README.md`: A brief explanation of the problem, the approach used, and complexity analysis.
